# Sherlock
Data Structure and Algorithms Problem Solutions.

# Commitment:

Each day atleast one solution

# TODO
Hackerrank already solved problem to be added.
Codechef problem solution to be added.

# Future Plans:

Solution of Hackerrank, Codechef, Codeforces and other sources will be available here.
Problem Solutions will be avaibale in Python, Golang, Java and Javascript at start.
Later solutions will be added in more languages. 

# Features:

Each solution may/might have link to some sources to follow up why this logic has been used. 
So go through them too for depth analysis or understanding.

e.g: int mid = low + ((high - low) / 2);
Why in binary search mid is calculated this way.


# Pull Request Appreciated.
